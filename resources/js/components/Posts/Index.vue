<!--

    Every Vue component consists of two parts: script and template tags.

    To initialize Vue app, add `PostsIndex` component and mount it to top app HTML element in resources/js/app.js

    We name component `PostsIndex` because it is component for Posts and Index.vue file. however for calling
    components in Vue files, there are 2 ways that Vue.js supports: using `kebab-used` (used in Vue template files)
    and PascalCase (For components naming as per the style guide)

    Notes:

    - We must compile Vue template file by running:`npm run build` everytime to reflect Vue file code changes

    - NO need to run: `npm run dev` separately because Laravel:`composer run dev` is already running on separate terminal
